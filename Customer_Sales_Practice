--#Using SQLLiteStudio, I'm querying a database with multiple tables to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

--# 1. How many orders were placed in January? Filter out incorrect Order IDs.

SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(OrderID) = 6 
AND OrderID <> 'Order ID'; 

--# 2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

--# 3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February?

SELECT distinct acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderID
WHERE length(OrderID) = 6 
AND OrderID <> 'Order ID';

--# 4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT Product, MIN(price) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan
GROUP BY product, price 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

--# 5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products)

SELECT SUM(quantity)*price AS total_revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

--# 6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT SUM(Quantity), Product, SUM(quantity)*price AS total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

--#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and
-- what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';
